package Getter_Setter;

//In computer science, a mutator method is a method used to control changes to a variable. They are also widely known as setter methods. Often a setter is accompanied by a getter (also known as an accessor), which returns the value of the private member variable.
//The getter method returns the value of the attribute. The setter method takes a parameter and assigns it to the attribute.
